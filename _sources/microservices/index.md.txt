## Advantages

- Faster delivery - Small size encourages frequent releases with less risk.
- Isolation - Single microservice cannot crash the entire system.
- Scaling - Individual services can be scaled on the need.
- Culture - Well defined ownership, high trust team.
- Flexibility - Polyglot services, own persistence systems etc.

## Disadvantages

- Increased complexity

## Challenges

- Service discovery
- Load balancing
- Fault tolerance
- Distributed tracing
- Telemetrics
- Security (mTLS, policies, patching)
- Granularity
- Bounded contexts
- Data modelling
- Independently releasable
- Service contracts
- Smart services, dumb-pipes
