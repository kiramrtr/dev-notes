# Dev Notes

As a developer I read and learn lot of stuff. Lately I've noticed I couldn't retain much and have to google again. So, though of creating a notes of stuff I learnt or learning and feel might be useful as a quick reference and refresher.

Running the project:

```
sphinx-autobuild source build/html
```
